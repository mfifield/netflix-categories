# Netflix Category Viewer 
### A little app for exploring the hidden categories in Netflix

Please run `npm install` first to ensure that you've got all the required packages.

Running `node app.js` will generate a JSON file containing all the Netflix categories, schedule a daily refresh task and start a server on port 3000. 

You'll be able to test the UI by going to http://localhost:3000 in a browser.
